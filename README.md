# Personal configuration

This is my personal settings for shell etc.

## Installing

**Warning** this will replace your existing "_dotfiles_".

Run the following command:

    make

This will copy the files to `$HOME` and the config will be ready to use.

## Requirements

* bash
* tmux > 1.7

#### Useless background

This is a very, very simple setup. Some have a massive suite of tools and
fancy shells but I don't. I tried it but as I've been changing computers
a lot recently I found that I really like it simple.

I work with different servers every day and don't want a different shell
for every environment. Bash works perfectly good for me and that's what
I'm using until I decide to use something new and shiny.
